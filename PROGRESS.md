## 📝 Notes & Learnings

- Challenge focuses heavily on **out-of-school children** tracking - ensure this is prominent
- **Disaggregated data** (gender, disability, location, wealth) is critical for reporting
- **Learning outcomes** tracking (literacy/numeracy) is a new requirement vs original design
- Need to emphasize **affordability** and **sustainability** in submission

## 🎯 Next Session Checklist

- [ ] Confirm UNICEF submission deadline
- [ ] Decide on hosting provider (Railway, Render, or Heroku)
- [ ] Create GitHub repository
- [ ] Setup MongoDB Atlas free tier
